## <p align="center">[LIVE DEMO](https://detrett.github.io/weather-app/)

A website where you can check the forecast for the next 5 days.
It uses a Geolocation API to determine the user's location and a Weather API (Visual Crossing) to get the weather information.  
You can also search for a specific location and switch the units between the metric and imperial system.  
Note: The free version of the APIs are capped, notably the geolocation API, so if the website doesn't work as intended it might be that the limit has been reached.
